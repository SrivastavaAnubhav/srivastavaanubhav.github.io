		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p>
			Hi, I'm Anubhav. I'm a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I enjoy learning new things and challenging
			myself to make cool new things. Outside of CS/programming, I enjoy academic trivia (Quizbowl), music (mostly playing,
			but listening too), and badminton.

					<h3>
						This is Postura.
					</h3>
				</a>
				I suffer from pretty bad neck and arm pain, stemming from bad posture. The problem isn't that I don't know what's wrong,
				it's that I forget to sit with correct posture for long periods of time, and only notice the damage I've done after the
				fact.
				</br>
				</br>
				Postura tracks a user's face with their webcam (using OpenCV) and alerts them when they move outside of the range of good
				posture.

		<h2> Analogies </h2>
		<p> 
			I like analogies, and think they're a really great way to learn. They're kind of like head start, letting you compare new things to things you already know. Here are some that I've heard/created! 
			</br> Fair warning: a lot of these will be about CS
		<ul>
			<li> Amortized runtime is like the opposite of a rewards card: instead of getting a lot of bubble tea then getting a free one, you pay a LOT for 1 and the rest are super cheap! </li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h2> Thoughts/Opinions </h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li> Any field of study ending in "theory" is interesting </li>
				<li> Mint is a bad flavour </li>
				<li> Apple cider is the only good hot beverage </li>
			</ul>
