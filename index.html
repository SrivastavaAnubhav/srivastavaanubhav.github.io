		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p>
			Hi, I'm Anubhav. I'm a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I enjoy learning new things and challenging
			myself to make cool new things. Outside of CS/programming, I enjoy academic trivia (Quizbowl), music (mostly playing,
			but listening too), and badminton.

					<h3>
						This is Postura.
					</h3>
				</a>
				I suffer from pretty bad neck and arm pain, stemming from bad posture. The problem isn't that I don't know what's wrong,
				it's that I forget to sit with correct posture for long periods of time, and only notice the damage I've done after the
				fact.
				</br>
				</br>
				Postura tracks a user's face with their webcam (using OpenCV) and alerts them when they move outside of the range of good
				posture.
